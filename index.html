    <h1>Ultimate is a Sport!</h1>
    <h2>"I always had the ability to throw a frisbee pretty well. I don't why." -Joel Silver, one of the inventors of ultimate</h2>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <h4>The Early Years</h4>
    <p>The development of the game of ultimate frisbee began in 1965 at Amherst College in Amherst, Massachussets. Students Bob Fein, Richard Jacobson, Robert Marblestone, Steve Ward, Fred Hoxie, Gordon Murray, and others created a game using a plastic disc based off concepts from American football, basketball, and soccer. This game included many of the fundemental rules included in modern ultimate. In 1967, a man named Jared taught this game to Joel Silver. Joel and his friends further developed the game in 1968 at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. Joel presented the idea to the high school student council, and a year later the first official game between established teams was played between two groups of students. The first and second set of rules were written in 1970 by Joel Silver, Buzzy Hellring and Jon Hines. On November 7th, 1970 CHS played the first interscholastic game. They won over Millburn High School by a score of 43 to 10. (There was no point cap at the time.) During these early years of ultimate, most players used Wham-O discs and played in parking lots -- both practices frowned upon by today's ultimate players. </p>
